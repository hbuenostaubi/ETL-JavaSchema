# ETL-Airline Schema

The application conssists of 3 components: sql queries to generate "questions/answers" on the data for analysis in the overall KPIs of an airline, a java program to upload data and another one to render it for its users. Some of the data comes from open source data sources, as booking information is fairly private and other tables were filled in by me to make this diagram work. I did my best to recreate--and simplify--the airline industry from my perspective. 

Below is the schema diagram of the recreated airline schema.
