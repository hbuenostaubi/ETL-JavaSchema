# ETL-Airline Schema

The application conssists of 3 components: sql queries to generate "questions/answers" on the data for analysis in the overall KPI of an airline, a java program to upload data and another one to render it for its users. Some of the data comes from open source data sources, as booking information is fairly private--I did my best to recreate the business from my perspective.
